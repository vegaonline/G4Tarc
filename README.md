The code has been written using Geant4 toolkit developed at CERN. 
I am also one of the developers.

The code simulates the concept of Carlo Rubbia to transmute long lived fission fragments
to short lived or stable isotopes. This version uses proton beam from ADS (Accelerator
driven system) that hits a target of heavy metal like lead and uses spallation to 
create neutron shower. Lead blocks absorb and also thermalises neutron to lower energy
that reacts with the transuranic element that has to be treated in resonance region.

There is another version of the same code that uses small portable pulsed neutron source 
array. It does not need any accelerator. So this is not messy. It needs an array of 
portable pulsed neutron generator.
